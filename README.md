🚆 Railway Reservation System

📌 Overview

The Railway Reservation System is a database-driven software project designed to automate and simplify the process of booking and cancelling train tickets. Built as part of a DBMS case study, this project focuses on creating a reliable backend with SQL queries, triggers, and normalization while simulating real-world railway reservation operations.

It reduces manual errors in the offline process, ensures identity verification via Aadhaar, and allows users to search for trains, reserve/cancel tickets, and view booking status in a seamless way.

✨ Features

Passenger registration with Aadhaar verification
Book and cancel train tickets online
Real-time update of available seats through SQL triggers
Query support to fetch train details, ticket status, passenger information, etc.
Handles multiple ticket types: Sleeper, A-Tier, B-Tier, General
Data normalization up to BCNF
Sample queries for analytics (e.g., passenger demographics, availability, routes)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Database: Oracle SQL / MS SQL
Tools used: ER Modeling, Normalization, SQL Triggers, Views

🚀 Optional Future Enhancements

Add email/notification system for booking and cancellation updates
Implement dynamic seat selection instead of random berth allocation
Build a full-stack web interface
Integrate payment gateway simulation
